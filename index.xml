      <description>Goal This post is specially used for helping students who majored in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering Technology (FPSET) collaborated by SWJTU-OSU to master the knowledge of related fields deeper and quicker. Illustrations These materials have been saved since 2019, and some of them may no longer be effective today. Personally, I hope that you, as students, can use them appropriately as references to help yourself grasp knowledge more quickly. In that case, you would have more choices about your future path.</description>
