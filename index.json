It focuses on the basic requirements of the process and my reflections on participating in it.\rApplication and Exam Preparation I received the application notice from the department and my supervisor at the end of February. Shortly after that, the Shenzhen Loop Area Institute (SLAI) gave a presentation on the first-year student application process. The talk covered the examination details, program benefits, and overall objectives.\nSLAI is established to develop AI-related talented people in various areas. SLAI could afford bunches of GPU which means they have enough computing power SLAI is fully taught in English In order to apply it, you need to prepare for the exam which is about advanced mathmatics, linear algebra, statistics and coding. I started preparing it since March. Obviously, it did not have a clear exam outline in the first year, so I watched the admissions talk of Beijing Zhongguancun Academy. The point is to understand one book called 西瓜书 in Chinese. Here I put the book cover below.\nIt needs to be mentioned that your understanding about the formula derivation is one of the important aspect. The point is let you be familar with the formula principle that you may not no longer remember. For exmaple, the matrix calculation, the integration formula, and etc. Personally, I recommend on book called pumpkin-book. It it an open accessed book which is published in Github by Datawhale. Here I give the link: https://github.com/datawhalechina/pumpkin-book\nAlso, I took part in a course named Machine Learning. The course is basically about the principle of each algorithms, including machine learning, deep learning, and optimization parts. Here I put the content below.\nModel evaluation and optimization Model selection Supervised learning Unsupervised learning SVM and clustering Deep learning CNN RNN Reinforcement learning This course spans a total of 12 weeks, which is not quite enough to fully achieve our goal. However, it has helped me grasp some of the most important concepts by providing targeted questions.\nMaximum likelihood method Distribution knowledge Probability density function SLAI Selection Camp The selection camp was organized from 14th to 17th in April. The specific events have been listed below.\n14th: Student registration 15th: Examination 16th: Research proposal exam 17th: Interview Specifically, the examination lasts for three hours without any breaks. Before entering the room, you are only allowed to bring your identification card (ID) and pens—everything else is prohibited. If any smart devices, such as an Apple Watch or mobile phone, are found during the exam, your qualification will be immediately revoked.\nOn the second day, the exam will assess your ability to write a research proposal. In the morning, three speakers will each deliver a lecture on a different topic. Note-taking materials, including pens, are not permitted—your memory is the only tool you can rely on. After the lectures, all students will be brought into a single room. You will then be given a question related to one of the lectures, and you must choose one topic and respond to the specific prompt within a limited time (approximately two hours).\nThe final day is the most important part of the process. All students were divided into morning and afternoon sessions, but the specific order was not disclosed. You simply wait for your name to be called. As with previous stages, electronic devices were strictly prohibited. You were only allowed to bring your CV and an information collection form into the room. Students were first led to the library, where they waited for about 20 minutes. Then, each student was taken to the interview room, where the session began almost immediately. The interview consisted of two parts. The first part was a three-minute self-introduction in English, followed by an English Q\u0026amp;A session. The second part was a more general question-and-answer session with two interviewers. You were expected to respond to questions on the spot, and the topics may relate to any content in your CV.\nFrom my personal experience, the interviewers were particularly interested in my personal background, even more than my academic achievements. I also heard about some challenging questions, such as: “What would you do if your opinion differs from your supervisor’s?” or “How would you handle a team member who is not contributing to a group project?” The entire interview lasts about 20 minutes, with a clock displayed on the whiteboard to keep track of time.\nPersonal thoughts The whole process was both intense and unforgettable. I spent two months preparing for the exam, during which my research progress came to a complete halt. Despite the preparation, I felt mentally blank when facing the written test. I have to admit, the exam was extremely difficult and seemed more favorable to students with a strong background in mathematics. The lectures on the second day also felt somewhat disconnected from my field. The first topic focused on catalysts, the second on computer vision, and the third on ethical principles in artificial intelligence—none of which aligned closely with my research interests. Moreover, the waiting time before the interview was mentally exhausting. Despite all the challenges, I still believe the experience was valuable and worth going through.\nOutcome Hard work paid off, and I was fortunate to receive the offer. I hope that any student reading this note will also achieve their goals and secure the opportunity they are striving for.\nMoments Updated on 28th May 2025\r","date":"May 28, 2025","hero":"/posts/casual-writing/phd_application/cover.jpg","permalink":"https://jackwu925.github.io/posts/casual-writing/phd_application/","summary":"This passage is a personal record of my PhD application journey.

In recent years, the computer industry has surpassed finance to become a popular industry. The proportion of overseas direct doctoral students has increased. Some schools will set up doctoral assessments, which means that before the assessment, the doctoral students are in a probation period. Only after passing the probation can they be transferred to formal doctoral programs. The maximum period is 6 semesters, which varies from school to school. In fact, the foreign probation is similar to the doctoral thesis proposal in China. It requires a comprehensive assessment of research background, research plan, research content, research progress, etc. Generally, there are three chances.

His ability to articulate his thoughts so clearly and persuasively had a facinated effect on the rest of us.\rWe found ourselves naturally gravitating towards his perspective as it seems to offer a fresh and insightful approach to the task at hand.\rHis leadership was instrumental in the completion of our project, and I was genuinely curious about how he managed to develop such stronger viewpoints and present them in such a convincing manner.\rWhen I asked him about this he shared a piece of advice.\rHe encouraged me to read more books to cultivate my thinking and accumulate more knowledge materials.\rHe believed that is the key to develop a solid foundation to one's opinions.\rBy doing so, he explained, one can not only form stronger opinions but also be able to confidently argue those views, because they were based on the rich diversity of information and experience.\rOverall, in this collaboration, his powerful ideas and arguments extremely inspired me to learn from him and read more books to enrich myself as well.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rPart3 No.1 Keen on reading\rYour browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rWell, there are several reasons behind people's passion for reading.\rFirst, it's an excellent way to gain knowledge and expand one's understanding of the world.\rBooks cover a vast range of subjects, from science and history to philosophy and art, providing readers with an endless source of information.\rThis thirst for learning can be very satisfying and is a driving force for many avid readers. Moreover, reading serves as a form of escapism allowing people to temporarily leave out their own reality and immerse themselves in different worlds or experiences.\rIt's a powerful tool for stress relief, as it helps divert attention away from daily worries and challenges.\rFor some, this escape into fictional realms can even inspire creativity and imagination, encouraging them to think outside of the box.\rAnother aspect that draws people to books is the emotional connection they conform with stories and characters.\rReading often evokes strong emotions whether its joy, sadness and excitement which can be a deeply rewarding personal experience. It also promotes empathy by giving readers an insight into diverse perspective and life situations, helping to forster a more compassionate society.\rAdditionally, in today's fast paced digital age, where we are constantly bombarded with information, reading offers a slower more contemplative activity.\rIt encourages critical thinking and analytical skills as readers must actively engage with the text, interpreting meanings and drawing connections.\rThis mental exercise is benefical to cognitive development and maintaining sharpness of mind.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.2 Strong opinions\rYour

sustainability and the flight against the climate change.\rThey advocate for green energy, less plastic use, and more responsible consumption.\rThis generation, seems to be more aware of their impact on the planet and the importance of taking action.\rAnother topic where you'll find strong opinions among youth is technology and social media.\rWhile they are often the most adept at using these tools, there's also growing concern about privacy, data security, and the negative effects of too much screen time.\rSome feel enpowered by the connectivity, while others worried about the loss of genuine human interaction.\rSocial justice and equality issues also ignite a lot of passion in younger demographics.\rMovements like \"Me Too\", \"Black live matters\" and \"LGBT+ rights\" have seen significant support from young people who are vocal about wanting a fairer and more inclusive society.\rThey are not afraid of challaging the status quo and push for reforms.\rEducation is another field where young individuals express strong views.\rThey are desired for a more practical and relevant curriculum as well as a system that caters to different learning styles and abilities.\rThey want an education that prepares them to the real world and equips them with skills that will be useful in their future careers.\rLastly, politics can be a contentious issue, especially in times of political unrest or when there are major policy changes.\rYoung people tend to be quite engaged whether it's through voting, protesting, and participating in online discussions.\rThey care deeply about the directions their countries are heading and often have clear ideas about what kind of leadership they believe is needed.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.3 Public noise\rYour browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rIn my opinion, the majority of people do find it bother some when others talk loudly on their phones in public spaces.\rThis is primarily because such behaviour can disrupt the peace and quiet that many individuals seek when they are out in public.\rFor instance, in libraries or in public transport, where silence is expected that the sound of someone's conversation can be particularly distracting.\rMoreover, it can also be seen as a lack of respect for those around them.\rWhile some might argue it is a matter of personal freedom to speak on the phone wherever one pleases, the negative impact on others often outweights the individual right.\rTherefore, it is generally considered courteous to limit phone conversations in public areas to avoid causing discomfort to those nearby.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.4 Help parents\rYour browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rCertainly children can contribute to the household in numerous ways.\rFirstly, they can take on some of the ligher chores that suit their age and abilities, such as setting the table, clearing it after meals or helping with laundry by folding clothes.\rThis not only eases the workload for parents but also teaches kids responsibility and the importance of teamwork.\rMoreover, children can assist in organizing and maintaining a tidy living space.\rThey could be responsible for keeping their rooms clean, putting away toys and even participating in more general cleaning activities around the house.\rIt's benefical for them to learn these skills early on as it fosters independence and self-reliance.\rAdditionally, older children might help with look after younger siblings, especially when parents are occupied with other tasks.\rThis can include playing with them, reading stories, or simply ensuring they are safe while adults are busy.\rSuch roles can strengthen sibling bonds and teach patience and nurturing qualities.\rFurthermore, in today's digital world, many children are more tech savvy than their parents.\rThey can use this to their advantage by helping out with technology related issues, like setting up new devices, teaching parents how to use apps or assisting with online shopping and bill payments.\rLastly, emotional support is another important way children can help.\rJust being there to listen, offering a hug or engaging in family conversations can make a significant difference in the overall mood and well being of the home.\rA supportive and positive atmosphere is essential for a happy family life.\rSource: 95226119542

considerations.\rOn one hand, zoos offer a unique opportunity for children to observe and learn about a wide variety of animals that they might not otherwise have the chance to see.\rThis direct exposure can inspire curiosity and foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of wildlife and the natural world.\rAdditionally, many modern zoos are committed to conservation efforts, education and research, which means that visitors can contribute to important causes beyond just entertainment.\rFor instance, well designed exhibits often include information about the animals natural habitats, behaviors and the challenges they face in the wild.\rThis can help children develop awareness of environmental issues and the importance of protecting endangered species.\rMorever, interactive programs such as feeding sessions or keeper talks can make the learning process engaging and memorable, potentially inspiring future generations to care more about nature and biodiversity.\rOn the other hand, there are valid concerns that welfare of animals in captivity. It's important for parents to choose zoos that adhere to high standards of animal care, and provide environments that closely mimic the animal's natural habitats.\rSome argue that keeping animals in captivity no matter how well intentioned can never fully replicate the freedom and complexity of life in the wild.\rTherefore, it's crucial for parents to engage in discussions with their children about the ethical aspects of zoos and the responsibilities we have towards wildlife.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.5 Differences between doctors and nurses\rYour browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rThe roles of doctors and nurses, while both essential to the health care system, are distinct in terms of their responsibilities, training and the way they interact with patients.\rFirstly, when it comes to education and qualifications, doctors typically undergo a longer and more specialized training process. They need to complete a bachelor's degree, followed by medical school which is usually another four years. After that, they must go through a residency program which can last three to seven years depending on their specialization.\rIn contrast, nurses usually earn a diploma or an associate's degree, though many now pursue a bachelor's degree in nursing.\rThis generally takes two to four years, and they must past a licencing exam to practice.\rRegarding their duties, doctors are primarily responsible for diagnosing illnesses, prescribing treatments and performing surgeries.\rThey make critical decisions about patient care, often based on complex diagnosed information and medical knowledge.\rNurses on the other hand, focus more on providing direct patient care, monitoring health conditions, administering medications and educating patients and their familys about managing their health.\rNurses also play a key role in supporting emotional well beings of patients, acting as a bridge between the patient and the doctor.\rThe scope of practice varies.\rDoctors have broader authorities to prescribe medications, order tests and perform certain procedures.\rNurses however, work within a defined scope that is regulated by their licence and may include some prescriptive authorities under specific circumstances.\rBut this is generally more limited compared to that of a doctor.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.6 What are the advantages and disadvantages of shopping in small shops\rYour browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rOn the positive side, small shops often offer a more personalized shopping experience.\rThe owners and staff tend to know their customer well which can lead to better customer service.\rThere's usually a sense of community within these shops as they often serve a local clientele and can become a integral part of neighborhood.\rMoreover，small shops may stock unique or locally made items that you wouldn't find in larger chain stores, providing a distinctive selection of products.\rAnother advantage is that by supporting small businesses, you're contributing to the local economy.\rThe money you spent in such shops is more likely to stay within the community, helping to create job opportunities and maintain the character of the area.\rSmall shops also have the flexibility to adapt quickly to changing consumer demands and trends as they don't have to go through a long corporate decisiom making process.\rHowever, there are some downsides to shopping at small shops as well. For instance, the range of products available can be limited compared to what you'd find in a large supermarket or department store.\rThis means that if you are looking for a wide variety of choices, you might not find everything you need in a single small shop.\rAdditionally, prices in small shop can sometimes be higher due to the lack of economies of scale.\rThey may not be able to buy in bulk and get same discounts as bigger retailers.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.7 What do people often complain about\rYour browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rI honestly never thought about that before as most people in my country are naturally patient.\rHowever if I have to choose one, it's definitely the complaints regarding online shopping.\rDue to its popularity, a lot of Chinese people prefer this option when purchasing their needs.\rUnfortunately, in some rare cases things don't always go as planned.\rFor instance, some parcels may turn out to be damaged which can really cause inconvenience to people as the return process may take a longer time, which could lead to more displeasure.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.8 Who likes to stay at home more, young people or older people\rYour browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rWhether young people or old people prefer to stay at home can vary greatly depending on the individual, but there are some general trends that we can observe.\rFor many older adults, staying at home is often a prefered choice due to several factors.\rFirst, as one ages, physical limitations and health issues may make it more challenging to go out frequently, so the comfort and convenience of their own home become increasingly appealing.\rAdditionally, older individuals might have already experienced a lot in life and could find contentment in simpler activities, such as reading, gardening, or spending time with family.\rOn the other hand, young people tend to be more socially active and adventurous.\rThey are often eager to explore new places, meeting new friends, and engage in various social activities.\rHowever, it's important to note that not all young people fit this mode.\rSome may enjoy the tranquility of being at home, perhaps to study, work on personal projects, or simply to relax away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.\rThe rise of digital entertainment and remote work has also made staying at home a more attractive option for younger generations, allowing them to connect with each others and even work without leaving their homes.\rIn summary, while these is a tendency for older people home to spend more time at home, both age groups has their reasons for preferring either option.\rIt really comes down to personal preferences, lifestyle and circumstances.\rWhat's interesting is how these preferences can change over time and how technology is influencing our habits across all ages.\rSource: 95226119542 xhs\rNo.9 Why do old friends lose touch with each other Your browser does not support the video tag.\rSubtitles\rWell, there are a variety of reasons why old friends might lose touch with each other.\rOne of the most common is that people's lives change as they grow older.\rFor instance, after finishing school or university, individuals may move to different cities or even countries for work or further education, which makes it more difficult to maintain contact.\rAdditionally, as we get older, our priorities and interests can shift.\rWe might become busy with careers, starting families or dealing with personal issues, leaving less time for socializing with friends.\rThe frequency of communication often decreases and over time, the connection can weaken.\rMoreover, in today's fast paced society, the way we communicate has changed dramatically.\rWith the rise of social media, we have more ways than ever to stay in touch, but sometimes these platforms can also create a false sense of connection.\rPeople may think they're keeping up with their friends lives by following them online, without having meaning conversation or spending quality time together.\rLastly, sometimes friendship simply run their course.\rAs people evolve, they might find that they don't share the same values, interests, or lifestyles and this can lead to a natural drifting apart.\rIt's not always a negative thing, it's just a part of life and personal growth.
