      <description>English corner is always a perfect place for me to improve my English skill.I&amp;rsquo;ve taken part in this activity for more than half a year, this place always relax me when I am under pressured by academic researches. Every week I will make the reservation and be there on time.
Although each session just lasts for one hour, it&amp;rsquo;s worthy doing that. I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated many words and expressions since then.</description>

      <description>Recording the learning process is always my personal preference. Anyone who has the needs to practice speaking can use these records if it helps.Every single word was basically typed by hand through listening. Please correct any mistake by mailing me (jackwu925@mail.ustc.edu.cn) and thank you for the effort.Part2 No.1 Healthcare professionalsYour browser does not support the video tag.SubtitlesThe person I&#39;d like to talk about is my cousin Sara.</description>
