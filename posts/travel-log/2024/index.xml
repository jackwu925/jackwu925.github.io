      <description>It was a amazing and impressive golden holiday. We haven&#39;t had such a crazy time in a long time. This time, 7 days, one car and three people, passing through forests, lakes, mountains and glaciers, was an unforgettable experience for us.&amp;#x1f697; Car selection Toyota (T-ROC) &amp;#x1f9ed; Self-driving map ðŸ‘£Total mileageï¼šAbout 3,000 kms&amp;#x1f4f8; Some moments </description>

Although there was no rainbow in the end, the finished video was quite a surprise!ðŸ˜„Video Your browser does not support the video tag.by Jack Wu</description>

      <description>Honestly, it&#39;s my very first time to come to the northern of Sichuan province.
